                At <strong>The Urology Place</strong>, we want our patients to have access to the
                newest and most effective treatments for prostate cancer. <strong>Pluvicto™</strong> is
                an FDA-approved therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other
                parts of the body and no longer responds to standard treatments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Pluvicto works by finding a protein (called <strong>PSMA</strong>) that is commonly
                found on prostate cancer cells. Once it finds these cancer cells, it delivers a small
                amount of radiation directly to them, helping to kill the cancer while limiting damage
                to healthy cells.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our team will guide you through every step of the process — from deciding if Pluvicto
                is right for you to monitoring your progress during treatment. We work closely with your
                other doctors to make sure you receive safe, personalized, and effective care.

                    Pluvicto is a <strong>targeted therapy</strong> that helps fight advanced prostate
                    cancer. It works by finding a protein called PSMA that is often found on prostate
                    cancer cells. Once it attaches to these cells, Pluvicto delivers a{" "}
                    <strong>small amount of radiation directly to the cancer</strong>, helping to kill it

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This targeted approach allows doctors to treat cancer that has spread, while
                    minimizing side effects compared to traditional treatments. Your care team at{" "}
