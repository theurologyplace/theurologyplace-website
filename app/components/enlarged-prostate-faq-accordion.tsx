    answer: (
      <p>
        BPH treatment options have become less and less invasive with clever new techniques. At The
        Urology Place, we have looked for new options with our patients with at least 3 year data
        showing durable and promising results.

    question: "Does The Urology Place have experience with BPH treatments?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        We have significant experience with all the options. In fact, Dr. Kella was the first surgeon
        to perform UroLift in Texas and he was the first person to perform iTind in the Southwest.

    question: "When is treatment needed?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Patients&apos; quality of life suffers with repeated waking up at night, a dribbling stream,
        rushing to the bathroom to avoid an accident, or leaking after you have just urinated. Men with
        any of these symptoms can try medication. However, medication may not work, can create
        side-effects, and have to be taken for life. Treatment makes sense at this point.
