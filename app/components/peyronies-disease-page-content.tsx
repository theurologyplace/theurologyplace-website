              Peyronie&apos;s disease is the curvature of the penis that can be physically uncomfortable and
              emotionally distressing on a man, especially if shortening or &ldquo;hour glass&rdquo; deformity of
              the penis occurs.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-800 md:text-lg">
              Falopius described the first curvature in a patient in 1561. Surgeon Peyronie himself described 5
              cases. They were treated by bathing in the waters of Barege in France in 1743 (water unavailable in
              our offices).

              A trip to the urologist can confirm diagnosis. Some signs and symptoms include the following:

              There are various causes to explain why Peyronie&apos;s may occur that include but are not limited to
              testosterone levels (even if ED is not present), genetics, and underlying conditions. There have been
              studies that show a link between Peyronie&apos;s and Dupuytren&apos;s Contracture which is a disease
              affecting the tendons in the fingers and other joints. Studies have shown that there are also a few
              inflammatory disorders that hold an influence on gene mutation for chromosome 11.

                    What causes a bent or curved penis?

                    Some men can have a very mild curve, which is natural. If a curve worsens or is more dramatic,
                    this is possibly PD. Bent penis occurs when fibrous tissue forms a plaque underneath the skin of
                    the penis and acts as a scar, preventing the natural stretch of the penis during erection. While
                    the exact cause differs, many men report an injury to the penis that occurred during sex. A snap
                    is heard or felt, and sometimes men notice bruising on the penis. The injury heals over time, but
                    a plaque is formed.

                    Penile injury is, in fact, pretty common. Although the development of plaque in the penis after
                    injury, called Peyronie&apos;s Disease, is not as common — it can affect as many as 1 out of 10
                    men. Unfortunately, this common condition is often hidden due to embarrassment. We have the
                    spectrum of treatments to fight PD.

                Tadalafil and Pentoxifylline has been effective for Peyronie&apos;s. A recent randomized study has
                shown a 10% improvement in plaque and reduction of pain with the use of Tadalafil. In regards to
                Pentoxifylline, a randomized and controlled trial had shown the reduction of curvature with this
                medication.

                or low intensity shockwave therapy helps stimulate the growth of small blood vessels and nerve
                tissue. The shockwaves are able to break up microplaque as well. The American Urology Association
                considers shockwaves effective for any pain with Peyronie&apos;s, which is known as the acute phase.
                The effect of soundwaves for treating the penis curve is mixed. However, a recent study had noted
                improvement when the soundwaves were directly targeting into the plaque. Luckily, the treatment does
                not have any downtime or side-effects associated.
