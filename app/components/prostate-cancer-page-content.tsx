              If you have been diagnosed with prostate cancer, you may have heard about robotic prostate 
              surgery, or a robotic prostatectomy. Many patients initially feel overwhelmed with a prostate 
              cancer diagnosis. We are happy to see patients for a second opinion. 
              At The Urology Place we work with our patients to help them make informed, appropriate decisions 
              for their particular case. After treating thousands of prostate cancer patients, we have become 
              known for our prostate cancer outcomes.{" "}

              Dr. Kella and his expert surgical team have been working together for over 10 years, 
              making them one of the most specialized teams in the nation for prostate cancer removal. 
              We employ specialized procedures to avoid heat from cautery and minimize tension on the prostate, 
              which are two key factors in recovery.

              Some prostate cancers grow slowly, and a patient is more likely to die of other causes
              before the cancer becomes severe. In those situations, patients may choose to watch the
              disease carefully. Patients with small amounts of cancer or a low Gleason score may be
              candidates for active surveillance. Patients with many medical problems or who are
              elderly may prefer a &ldquo;watch and wait&rdquo; approach because of the potential
              complications of more aggressive treatment.

            <p className="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-800 md:text-lg">
              Decisions about prostate cancer treatment can be difficult. Physicians sometimes use
              genetic testing and other tools to decide how best to move forward. Seeking a second
              opinion is advisable in all cases, and especially when the best path is unclear after
              talking with your urologist.{" "}
              <span className="font-medium text-slate-900">Dr. Kella</span> at The Urology Place in
              San Antonio, Texas is often sought for an expert second opinion because of his depth of
