              Please note: Coverage for in-office anesthesia varies by insurance plan. Our team will verify your benefits prior to your procedure; however, depending on your specific plan, anesthesia services may be considered an out-of-pocket expense.

              Dr. Kella was recommended to me by a friend who checked him out through a relative up at Mayo. The comments were excellent so my friend chose Dr. Kella and sailed through the robotic prostatectomy operation and recovery. In less than 6 weeks he was back doing his bike races! So, I followed suit and had similar success minus I have had the lowest possible PSA scores for our facility.

              I&apos;m so glad I met the Urology Place. I suffered from urinary incontinence and my biggest fear was needing surgery but they recommended their Emsella chair for treatments. The treatments were quick, painless, and I didn&apos;t even need to remove my clothes! I can sneeze, laugh and cough without fear now! Totally worth it!
